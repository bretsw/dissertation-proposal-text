In this study, I will interview early-career educators about from whom they seek support during induction and how they use social media for this, if at all. From qualitative thematic analysis of the interviews, I will develop and administer a quantitative survey to see how common these induction experiences are. Because much is still unknown in this area, findings from my this study should benefit early-career educators as well as their teacher educators and mentors. 2.1 Keywords early-career educators, induction, social media, professional learning networks "],
["introduction.html", "3 Introduction", " 3 Introduction Early-career educators (ECEs) face numerous challenges during their transition from educator preparation programs into professional employment contexts (i.e., their induction period). ECEs seek support from a variety of sources during this time. The teacher induction literature has reported a “two worlds pitfall” (Feiman-Nemser &amp; Buchmann, 1985) caused by conflicting messages from the academic world of the preparation program and the practical world of the professional teaching context. ECEs enter their school of employment with notions of teaching that are not shared — or in some instances, are even actively discouraged — by more experienced colleagues and administrators in that school setting. ECEs must then try to navigate and reconcile conflicting messages to decide how they will enact educational practice. Often, contextual pressure to adapt to the employment environment means that worthwhile academic notions of education from preparation programs are abandoned by ECEs (Feiman-Nemser &amp; Buchmann, 1985). Further complicating teacher induction is the new reality that ECEs are no longer seeking help with their profession from just two worlds. Through social media—a set of participatory practices for using media socially and publicly (Humphreys, 2016) — educators’ traditional two worlds have expanded to a universe of many worlds — an edu-verse. Thus, ECEs may have to navigate conflicting messages about what and how to teach from their preparation program, local employment context, and social media platforms. However, research on educators’ use of social media has rarely focused on the particular challenges experienced by and needs of ECEs. The purpose of this study is to explore what supports for professional learning ECEs seek during induction, if any; from whom; and how, if at all, they use social media with the intention of seeking supports and connections. This research purpose fills a gap between the induction literature, which does not fully consider recent technological advancements, and the social media literature, which does not take into account the needs of new educators. It is likely that ECEs are seeking supports for induction needs from far more sources today than have been previously studied — supports from and through social media should be specifically considered. In addition, the intense professional and personal dissonance that comes with moving from learning about teaching to actually practicing teaching suggests the challenges and needs of ECEs are likely far more complicated than have been accounted for by research on educators’ uses of social media generally. From a practical perspective, it is important to explore and understand this gap because ECEs are already experiencing and navigating a new professional reality — a rapidly expanding edu-verse created by the current social media landscape.

["framework.html", "4 Framework", " 4 Framework This study is framed by a professional learning network (PLN) lens. Trust (2012) defined a PLN as “a system of interpersonal connections and resources that support informal learning” (p. 133). A PLN lens is well-suited to frame this study because it focuses on educators’ professional learning while expanding the scope of interpersonal connections to account for global reach through the Internet without discounting local, offline relationships. For instance, respondents in Trust, Krutka, and Carpenter’s (2016) survey study described the scope of their PLNs in various ways, including solely in terms of face-to-face (i.e., offline) components, solely in terms of online components, and in terms of both face-to-face and online (i.e., blended) components. In addition, although Trust’s (2012) definition highlighted the benefit of PLNs for informal learning, other studies have acknowledged that PLNs include elements of traditional professional development while also extend beyond these formal learning environments (Krutka, Carpenter, &amp; Trust, 2017; Prestridge, 2019). For instance, Kim, Frank, and Spillane (2018) described how schools are composed of both a formal organization (i.e., defined teacher positions and roles) as well as informal networks (i.e., who students turn to for expertise). It may be the case that ECEs experience a similar mix of formal and informal induction supports in the local school context, incorporating both officially assigned mentors as well as relationships that more organically emerge as supports. The inclusion of social media then further expands ECEs’ opportunities for informal mentoring and access to expertise, in addition to elements of formal learning (Greenhow &amp; Lewin, 2016). In sum, PLNs often incorporate a mix of both formal and informal elements spanning both local and global contexts. The scope of a PLN lens — including both face-to-face and online as well as formal and informal elements — has the potential to address the gap between research on teacher induction and research on educators’ use of social media. In terms of makeup, PLNs are interpersonal connections (i.e., people and groups), and between these people and groups are being passed supports for professional learning — what Trust (2012) termed “resources” but could include knowledge, skills, curricular materials, and encouragement in addition to general resources. Finally, the emphasis of a PLN on professional learning may suggest that there are some underlying reasons why educators are seeking interpersonal connections and supports. These underlying reasons may imply a deficit in professional development elsewhere (e.g., district workshops focused on general teaching practices rather than the specific nuances needed for teaching a particular subject) or a heightened need among new educators for just-in-time support as they continue to learn to teach (e.g., how to lead an inquiry-based lesson tomorrow on a specific computer-science principle or skill). PLNs are reminiscent of Packard’s (2003) earlier composite mentoring concept, defined as “the strategic selection of a diverse set of mentors, each mentor offering one aspect of the desired mentoring experience” (p. 337). For novices who are unable to find one mentor who embodies all that they wish to become, composite mentoring allows them to take an active role in finding their desired mentoring experiences (Packard, 2003). PLNs further broaden the scope from mentoring to more general professional learning; both models assume that novices are taking a constructivist posture in their own development. Flanigan (2011) encapsulated these ideas by characterizing PLNs as grassroots movements initiated by educators. "],
["review-of-literature.html", "5 Review of Literature 5.1 Teacher Induction 5.2 Educators’ Use of Social Media 5.3 Summary of the Literature", " 5 Review of Literature I review the literature for what has been studied and what is yet unknown regarding what supports for professional learning ECEs seek during induction, if any; from whom; and how, if at all, they use social media with the intention of seeking supports and connections. This review examines two bodies of research that inform this inquiry: research on teacher induction and research on educators’ use of social media. Although these two areas of scholarship would seem to be potentially related, to date they are almost entirely disparate. I structure this review with sections suggested by the PLN framework: supports for professional learning, reasons for these supports, and interpersonal connections as sources of supports. 5.1 Teacher Induction The teacher induction literature has often conceptualized induction supports as formal, top-down professional development programs offered by schools and districts. The specifics of these induction supports are important because, as Ronfeldt and McQueen (2017) argued, the quality of induction supports is likely at least as important as the number of supports, if not more so. In addition, this body of research has argued that induction supports should be targeted, systematic, and structured (Kang &amp; Berliner, 2012; Zhukova, 2018). Formal induction programs. The literature describes several types of supports that teacher induction programs offer ECEs, both locally and remotely. In a local context, skills and knowledge are offered through mentoring relationships as well as through seminars and workshops (Fantilli &amp; McDougall, 2009; Kang &amp; Berliner, 2012; Ronfeldt &amp; McQueen, 2017). Collaborative work times provide assistance with teacher planning (Fantilli &amp; McDougall, 2009; Kang &amp; Berliner, 2012; Ronfeldt &amp; McQueen, 2017). Finally, help with classroom management and differentiation of instruction is offered through providing extra classroom assistance to ECEs (Kang &amp; Berliner, 2012). The nature of these programs varies, with some being scheduled (e.g., workshops) and others just-in-time and on-demand (e.g., mentors, classroom assistance). Although not nearly as common as local, formal induction programs, the idea of connecting new teachers to induction supports beyond the local context has been considered for nearly 25 years. An early example was Singletary and Anderson’s (1995) book chapter on computer-mediated teacher induction. Putnam and Borko (2000) described how the Internet can aid new teachers in the ongoing process of learning to teach “by providing new avenues to access to distributed expertise” (p. 11), but they also raised a number of cautions, such as: the potential lack of critical reflection in online communities, the impact of virtual learning communities on local connections, and the overall need to support ECEs to engage in productive online discourse about teaching and learning. More recently, Alemdag and Erdem (2017) designed an “e-mentoring” program for ECEs in Turkey that used both asynchronous (e.g., discussion forums, blogs) and synchronous (e.g., video conferencing) communication tools to connect mentors and new teachers regardless of geographic location in the country. They concluded that e-mentoring could be an effective support for ECEs if careful attention is given to the recruitment of participants and design of communication. Finally, März and Kelchtermans (2020) described ECEs’ existing informal, “school-external” networks where they seek support often related to issues (e.g., culture, norms, values, rules) in their school of employment. Reasons for offering induction programs. The teacher induction literature is explicitly focused on the needs of ECEs. Ingersoll and Strong (2011) noted that formal induction programs have helped ECEs transition between being students of teaching to teachers of students. This points to a significant underlying reason for ECEs’ needs: the transition from preparation to practice. ECEs have completed their formal professional preparation and are faced with having primary responsibility for enacting educational practice in a professional setting — ECEs must adjust to carrying the weight of no longer being a student or apprentice, but being the teacher of record. Three realities for ECEs stand out as related to their induction challenges and underlying reasons why they need induction support: everything is new, ECEs are still learning, and ECEs are still developing their professional identities. I unpack these three reasons in the following paragraphs. First, ECEs’ need for induction support stems from the challenge that everything in their professional lives is new. ECEs are adjusting to new colleagues, administrators, students, curriculum, school culture, and politics (Stanulis, Little, &amp; Wibbens, 2012). Because of this newness, ECEs are not able to work with the same efficiency as their more experienced colleagues, and they end up working a disproportionate amount of time just to get by (Fantilli &amp; McDougall, 2009). The focus of educational practice changes with experience. New teachers are just trying to survive, largely focused on personal concerns and resolving classroom management issues; more experienced teachers are able to start focusing on curriculum and teaching practices; and only later are teachers able to finally focus on long-term thinking and student learning (Thompson, Windschitl, and Braaten, 2013; Zhukova, 2018). Second, ECEs have been credentialed to teach, but they are still learning and honing their educational practice (Stanulis et al., 2012). Ingersoll (2012) explained that induction programs are built upon the assumption that teaching is a complex practice, with knowledge and skills that can only be fully developed by doing the work. Anderson and Stillman (2013) reviewed the literature and found that a dominant model of preservice teacher learning during their field experience is a replication of experienced educators’ practices; the challenge then as PSTs become ECEs in the transition from preparation to practice is to move beyond replication to recontextualization of practice appropriate for the ECEs’ specific classroom. Fantilli and McDougall’s (2009) survey study reported ECE challenges such as differentiating instruction to meet the needs of advanced students, communicating with parents, managing time for planning and scheduling, and managing students’ behavior in the classroom. These are skills addressed in preparation programs but not yet mastered by ECEs. Third, in addition to developing necessary skills, ECEs are also still forming their professional identities as educators — that is, how they understand themselves in relation to teaching (Cuddapah &amp; Clayton, 2011). The development of professional identity contains both intrapersonal and social processes. On one hand, professional identity is composed of values (i.e., personal beliefs and convictions), which are influenced by past experiences and in turn influence present goals (Wray &amp; Richmond, 2018). Values, experiences, and goals must be understood through an intrapersonal process of self-reflection. On the other hand, Pearce and Morrison (2011) argued that identity development is discursive, occurring through interactions with others — a social process. Wray and Richmond (2018) explained this in terms of positioning — that is, how an ECE behaves within a teaching community and how the members of that community view them in turn. Both intrapersonal and social processes require intentionality, meaning that professional identity is linked to agency — that is, the ability to take purposeful action (Pearce &amp; Morrison, 2011). Agentic actions are influenced by the intrapersonal elements of an ECEs’ identity: past experiences, beliefs, values, and goals — all in conjunction with context (Wray &amp; Richmond, 2018). For instance, a significant challenge for ECEs during induction is reconciling their personal values with competing values held by those in the new context, the school of employment (Thompson et al., 2013; Wray &amp; Richmond, 2018). An ECE’s sense of agency can affect whether or not he or she seeks induction supports or interpersonal connections. In addition, this means that an ECE’s ongoing professional-identity development during induction potentially requires rethinking their beliefs about education (Thompson et al., 2013). Finally, because of differences in identity formation, all ECEs do not develop their professional skills in the same way or at the same pace, instead following varying trajectories related to how they embrace and reconcile new ideas about educational practice as they learn on the job (Thompson et al., 2013). In sum, the induction transition places ECEs in contexts where everything is new, skills are still being developed, and professional identity — particularly personal values needing to be reconciled with those of the new context — is in flux. Thus, navigating the induction transition and making choices to seek induction supports require purposeful, agentic action. Interpersonal connections. The literature describes several types of interpersonal connections that formal induction programs help facilitate for ECEs. By far the most discussed relationship in the teacher induction literature is that between ECEs and mentor teachers. Ingersoll and Strong’s (2011) literature review found empirical evidence that mentoring programs had a positive impact on the performance and retention of new teachers, and Ronfeldt and McQueen’s (2017) study added nuance, concluding that not all mentoring relationships or programs are the same. Evertson and Smithey’s (2000) research demonstrated that training mentors lets them offer better help to early-career educators. Stanulis and Floden (2009) found benefit in an intensive form of mentoring that included mentors working closely and collaboratively with early-career educators — observing teaching, co-planning, and jointly analyzing student work. Finally, Davis and Higdon (2008) described how frequent “just-in-time” assistance from mentors was perhaps the most valuable aspect of the induction support program in their study. In sum, the literature seems to suggest that effective relationships between ECEs and mentors may be planned formally, but also require frequent and potentially informal (i.e., unscripted) interaction. Research has noted the benefit of ECEs receiving supportive communication from school leadership (Fantilli &amp; McDougall, 2009; Ronfeldt &amp; McQueen, 2017). Thomas, Tuytens, Devos, Kelchtermans, and Vanderlinde (2019) found that principals play a key role in welcoming ECEs and helping to organize induction support structures. Conversely, numerous studies have shown that ECEs name inadequate support from the school administration as one of the main factors for decisions to leave a teaching position (Fantilli &amp; McDougall, 2009; Ingersoll &amp; Strong, 2011). Although peer learning has perhaps been more thoroughly studied among preservice teachers, Thompson et al. (2013) described ECEs’ ongoing professional learning as potentially occurring in a community of their peers. Fresko and Alhija (2015) found that induction seminars could serve as learning communities for ECEs, offering participants the benefit of emotional support afforded by peers with the same professional status rather than hierarchical relationships. Cuddapah and Clayton (2011) studied such peer learning through a cohort of new teachers from across an urban school district that met together face-to-face every two weeks to learn about issues such as classroom management and identifying teaching resources. Finally, März and Kelchtermans (2020) described ECEs’ school-external networks that included former instructors and classmates from preparation programs, as well as family members. These relationships that were a step removed from the local employment context gave ECEs an outlet to discuss organizational concerns related to their schools. 5.2 Educators’ Use of Social Media Humphreys (2016) emphasized that social media should be thought of as a set of participatory practices for how people use media socially and publicly; this definition is not bounded by commercial platforms but instead focuses on how a medium is used. In contrast to research on teacher induction — which has often focused on supports formally organized and offered by districts and school — research on educators’ use of social media has tended to emphasize how educators have sought professional learning through social media platforms in ways that are self-initiated and informal. However, the social media literature only describes what is done by educators generally, not ECEs, because this body of research has not focused upon the challenges and needs of educators during induction. Some studies have focused on preservice teachers’ use of social media for a course assignment in a preparation program (e.g., Luo &amp; Clifton, 2017), but few studies have focused on how ECEs might use social media to look for help after gaining employment or to navigate the particular challenges of the induction transition. Humphreys’ (2016) definition and examples of social media encapsulate what earlier researchers (e.g., Greenhow, Robelia, &amp; Hughes, 2009) titled Web 2.0 — online platforms that provide opportunities for a variety of social processes, including social networking, social bookmarking, collaborative knowledge development, and so on. Social media differ from general online platforms or Internet tools because of their affordances for modes of participation that have the potential to be social and public. Social media offer opportunities to contribute as well as interact with content and with others around that content, as has been noted in studies of online affinity spaces (e.g., Gee, 2004; Staudt Willet, Koehler, &amp; Greenhalgh, 2017; Staudt Willet &amp; Carpenter, 2019). Greenhow et al. (2009) tied such features to theories of sociocultural activity and situated learning, noting that learning derives from participation in joint activities, is linked to social practices, and is mediated by artifacts over time. At their best, social media may offer opportunities for ECEs to experience ongoing professional learning in a participatory culture characterized by low barriers to expression and engagement, strong support for creating and sharing, informal mentoring, and a degree of social connectedness amongst contributors (Jenkins, 2009). However, participation inequality has been well-documented in Web 2.0 and social media (e.g., Nielson, 2006; Staudt Willet, 2019), meaning that users participate in drastically different ways, with a small number of participants contributing almost all of the content and forging almost all of the social connections. Most users participate through behaviors often characterized as lurking — that is, being present and watching but not making oneself known by contributing. Because lurkers are actively reading and paying attention — and may even be sharing what they see with others elsewhere — Edelmann (2013) argued that this prevalent form of participation would be better characterized as observing, a term with less negative connotation. Even if the bulk of social media users are not actively contributing to Jenkins’ (2009) vision of an online participatory culture marked by expression and creation, they are still engaging in a form of legitimate peripheral participation (Lave &amp; Wenger, 1991). Lave and Wenger (1991) likened legitimate peripheral participation to learning through apprenticeship. This is the process through which newcomers learn to belong and become full participants, which is both a social process as well as one of learning knowledgeable skills. In sum, even if a social media platform does not appear to host a robust participatory culture, it remains more than an online library or information repository because of its potential for users to participate, not just observe — to contribute, to interact with content (e.g., comment, critique, edit, modify, contextualize), and to connect with others around the content (Greenhow et al., 2009). The issue is less about the technological constraints of the social media platform, and more about agentic action. That is, some level of agency is needed to move from observing to taking chances with contributing, interacting with content, or connecting with others. Thus, as ECEs navigate potentially conflicting messages about what and how to teach from their preparation program, local employment context, and social media platforms, they are faced with issues of professional identity and agency. Informal learning opportunities. Macià and García (2016), in their review of the literature, offered one of the most comprehensive frameworks for the types of practices educators develop as they seek professional development through online communities and networks. These ten practices were: (a) share experiences and reflect on practice, (b) pose or answer questions or ask for help, (c) share teaching materials and resources, (d) generic discussion, (e) emotional support, (f) carry out concrete actions, (g) offer online training sessions, (h) share interests, (i) stimulate and manage participation, and (k) live events participation. Numerous empirical studies have reported findings related to what educators are looking for through their use of social media. For example, in a frequently cited study of educators’ participation in online communities, Hur and Brush (2009) interviewed teachers and found “five reasons why teachers wanted to participate in online communities of teachers: (a) sharing emotions, (b) utilizing the advantages of online environments, (c) combating teacher isolation, (d) exploring ideas, and (e) experiencing a sense of camaraderie” (pp. 290-291). Prestridge (2019) identified two main purposes of teachers’ social media use from her review of the literature. First, a people orientation toward social media means that educators share, collaborate, but also sometimes just lurk (i.e., observe) to learn who’s who in an online space. In contrast, a content orientation toward social media means that educators share and gather resources, although sometimes teachers just take without contributing. Prestridge (2019) observed that educators with a people orientation do not always engage with content, and educators with a content orientation do not always engage socially. From these observations, Prestridge (2019) built a new typology of social media use that did not assume either content creation or networking. Instead, her model contained two dimensions: an axis of people orientation (i.e., self versus other) and an axis of content orientation (i.e., taking versus contributing). With this model, Prestridge (2019) described four ways that educators use PLNs: info-consumer (self + taking), info-networker (other + taking), self-seeking contributor (self + contributing), and collaborative contributor (other + contributing, which Prestridge [2019] referred to as a vocationalist). Many studies have described learning opportunities related to a people orientation. Xing and Gao (2018) concluded that collaboration was an important factor in educators’ ongoing participation in Twitter #Edchat, possibly because they “valued tweets that focused on generating and co-constructing ideas” (p. 395). Davis (2015) described educators’ knowledge-sharing on Twitter as a type of collaborative inquiry and filtering information, and she reported a sense of belonging that teachers found through Twitter. Rehm and Notten (2016) found that educators continued to form new social ties as they spent more time on Twitter. Chen (2011) also reported a sense of “informal camaraderie” (p. 759) resulting from Twitter use, and other researchers have concluded that educators’ experiences of professional isolation can potentially be alleviated through participation on social media like Twitter (Carpenter &amp; Krutka, 2014; Wesely, 2013). Finally, educators’ use of social media for PLNs has been characterized as seeking and finding a “professional refuge” (Trust et al., 2016, p. 31); that is, a place where educators find encouragement and a restoration of energy for teaching. It is important to acknowledge that despite these cited benefits of educators using social media for a people orientation, there are numerous new challenges. First, with more voices offering purported wisdom and expertise, educators generally (and perhaps ECEs specifically) face a challenge of reconciling conflicting messages about what and how to teach. Related to this, with many more people to choose from, the complexity of finding a trusted mentor increases (Fantilli &amp; McDougall, 2009). Second, the ability to bypass time and geographical constraints also blurs the lines between teachers’ professional and personal lives, creating an expectation that teachers are — or should be — available and accessible to students, parents, and colleagues outside regular school-day hours (Fox &amp; Bird, 2017; Selwyn, Nemorin, &amp; Johnson, 2017). Third, with so many interpersonal connections, self-serving behaviors are prevalent. Prestridge (2019) defined two such types of social media users: the info-consumer and the self-seeking contributor. The latter user type mirrored my findings of tweet purposes in Twitter #Edchat: almost half of the original content in that hashtag is pointing back to one’s self — not highlighting the work or others or inviting dialogue. Lantz-Andersson, Lundin, and Selwyn (2018) asked related questions in their literature review covering 20 years of online teacher communities: Are educators working together or working alongside each other? Is participation on social media platforms fostering collaboration or competition? In sum, it is vital to keep in mind that more connections through social media are not inherently beneficial — the nature and quality of those connections must be examined. In addition to opportunities related to a people orientation, other empirical studies have described professional learning opportunities related to a content orientation. In their extensive survey study of how and why educators use Twitter, Carpenter and Krutka (2014) reported that 96% of survey respondents had shared and acquired educational resources on Twitter. Similarly, Trust et al. (2016) reported educators’ interpretations of their PLNs as “diverse and multifaceted networks of people, communities, tools, platforms, resources and sites” (p. 31) — in many cases facilitated by social media platforms. In a separate analysis of the same data, Krutka, Carpenter, and Trust (2016) identified five themes among educators’ PLN use: opportunities to engage, discover, experiment, reflect, and share. Tour (2017) interviewed three teachers and reported similar themes of PLN use: information retrieval, resource aggregation, cooperation, collaboration, reflections, and socializing. Duncan-Howell’s (2010) survey study found that educators wanted to select the content of their professional development, seeking learning through online communities that would relate to classroom practices relevant to their own contexts and situations. Although social media use may not appear to be directly analogous to offline workshops, educators use social media to develop skills and knowledge much like those offered by formal induction programs. For instance, social media platforms like Pinterest have expanded the scope of where and how curricular materials can be located (Hu, Torphy, Opperman, Jansen, &amp; Lo, 2018), and online discussion boards, like the subreddit r/teachingresources, have been created solely for the purpose of sharing resources, (Staudt Willet &amp; Carpenter, 2019). For planning, Twitter hashtags like #SocialMediaSyllabus and #MarginalSyllabus have been used to share and collaboratively develop teaching syllabi (Greenhow, Gleason, &amp; Staudt Willet, 2019). As with the benefits and challenges of people connections, it is important to acknowledge that despite these cited benefits of educators using social media to find and access resources, there are also potential challenges that may be introduced. To start, because of the volume of resources available through social media, ECEs may have difficulty finding a relevant resource (a search issue) and feeling confident in its quality. Also, with social media, the scope of resources is worldwide, raising a local-global tension where the plethora of available resources must be filtered and adapted to be appropriate for a specific educational context (Jones &amp; Preece, 2006). Finally, some supports offered by formal induction programs, like help with classroom management and differentiation of instruction, may be difficult to access through social media. Reasons for seeking supports on social media. Despite a growing body of research on educators’ use of social media, relatively little work has been done to specifically understand why educators use social media to connect with others. What professional learning opportunities educators are looking for has been widely investigated, but deeper Why? questions have been less explored. Still, Hur and Brush’s (2009) interview study is an example where participants described a number of external and contextual factors related to why educators participate in online communities. For instance, one interviewee said she shared emotions in the WeTheTeachers online community because “Teaching is a hard profession. We get emotionally involved. It’s nice to give and share those emotions with one another” (Hur &amp; Brush, 2009, p. 291). The difficulty of the job meant educators share personal and emotional stories online, and other educators offer emotional support or propose solutions. Hur and Brush’s (2009) participants also described searching for very specific ideas online, as well as utilizing the advantages of online communities specifically because of pressures to appear competent to colleagues in the place of employment — strangers were preferable confidants in some instances because they would have no bearing on future rehiring decisions. However, educators used large, open Facebook groups for pragmatic advice, not to reflect on their professional practice (Kelly &amp; Antonio, 2016). Kelly and Antonio (2016) speculated that this may be have been due to the public nature of these spaces connected to educators’ real-life identities. In a follow-up interview study, Mercieca and Kelly (2018) found that private groups on Facebook were places where educators — early-career educators, even — could access peer support that was not available to them in their local school of employment. Numerous studies of educators’ use of social media have reported professional isolation as a significant issue for teachers (Carpenter &amp; Krutka, 2014; Carpenter, McDade, &amp; Childers, 2018; Hur &amp; Brush, 2009; Trust &amp; Horrocks, 2017; Yadav, Gretter, Hambrusch, &amp; Sands, 2016). For instance, working in a small elementary school with only one teacher per grade level (Hur &amp; Brush, 2009) or teaching a specialized content area like computer science (Yadav et al., 2016) led educators to reason that the best opportunities to seek professional support were online. These purposes are similar to those of the school-external networks described by März and Kelchtermans (2020) in the teacher induction literature. In addition to subject- and level-specific advice, educators have also described benefitting from experiencing a sense of camaraderie through participation online (Carpenter &amp; Krutka, 2014; Hur &amp; Brush, 2009; Wesely, 2013). Interpersonal connections. Educators (in a general sense, not specifically ECEs) regularly use social media to connect with other people, often around the world (Trust, 2012). The question of who educators connect to for professional support is not entirely new. More than 20 years ago, Borko and Putnam (1996) described how ECEs learn to teach from other educators in their initial school of employment, as well as from students, professional development workshops, and reading. Still, the affordances of social media have expanded and transformed who educators are able to connect to: supports are no longer limited to local geography, the number of educators in a school building, the number of books in the school library, or the number and type of professional development programs offered by a school district. A teacher in Hur and Brush’s (2009) study reported that she first participated on a social media platform “for lesson plan ideas and classroom management help. Now I stick with it because I enjoy reading other people’s concerns, and what conditions are like in other states or countries” (p. 297). Researchers have found that teachers appreciated the ability to engage with online groups of educators for professional development without constraints due to time or geography and resulting in perspectives more diverse than would be available locally (Prestridge, 2017; Trust et al., 2016). The literature contains numerous examples of such interpersonal connections made by educators generally through social media. In some cases, social media platforms are used to reinforce existing, local relationships. For instance, Luo and Clifton’s (2017) preservice teachers in a educator preparation course used a common Twitter hashtag for class discussions. Reich, Levinson, and Johnston (2011) assigned preservice teachers to participate in class discussions not on a private board shared only among the class, but on the National Council for the Social Studies (NCSS) Network Ning. In both cases, these social media platforms (i.e., Twitter and Ning) were used for interactions among local preservice teachers in the same course, with the added benefit of conversations being public to a larger pool of educators who could choose to join in. Differing from these course assignments in that the local component was absent, Xing and Gao (2018) studied how educators connected globally through weekly synchronous discussions organized by the Twitter hashtag #Edchat. Finally, in a rare study of ECEs’ use of social media, Smith Risser (2013) followed one new teacher’s networking and connecting with mentors through Twitter. 5.3 Summary of the Literature The body of research on teacher induction and the body of research on educators’ use of social media share a broad interest in educators’ professional learning. These bodies of research also both tend to approach professional learning as social, ongoing, just-in-time, and needing recontextualization. Nevertheless, these bodies of research remain almost entirely disparate. The induction literature tends to focus on formal programs and local relationships whereas the social media literature tends to focus on informal learning opportunities and expansive, potentially global interpersonal connections. Of course, there are exceptions to these generalizations. Still, neither body of research fully meets the needs of ECEs. The induction literature focuses the scope of inquiry too narrowly to include people ECEs are likely talking to and learning from already (e.g., interpersonal connections on social media). On the other hand, the social media literature leaves the scope of inquiry too broad and general by not considering that there may be unique experiences and challenges faced by new educators transitioning from preparatory to professional context. See Table 1 for a summary comparison of these two bodies of research. Table 1 Comparison of the Teacher Induction and Social Media Literatures PLN Component Teacher Induction literature Social Media literature Supports for Professional Learning Primarily formal induction programs (e.g., mentoring, seminars, collaborative work times), some school-external networks Primarily informal learning opportunities (e.g., resources, skills, curricular materials, encouragement) Reasons for Supports Induction challenges (e.g., everything is new, still learning, professional-identity formation) General difficulty of teaching (e.g., emotionally tiring, needing to look for very specific ideas, pressures to appear competent to local colleagues, professional isolation) Interpersonal Connections Primarily local relationships (e.g., mentors, peers, administrators), some school-external networks (e.g., virtual learning communities, virtual workshops) Primarily global networks (e.g., Twitter hashtags, subreddits, Pinterest accounts), some local connections (e.g., course assignments for preservice teachers) It is noteworthy that research on teacher induction has tended to focus on local connections, most often in an educator’s school of employment and sometimes at the district level. Less considered are possible connections beyond the local context, such as emailing former colleagues from an educator preparation program or finding mentors through professional societies, let alone the potentially global set of interpersonal connections through social media. On the other hand, research on educators’ use of social media notes a common theme of educators’ appreciation for diverse and far-reaching interpersonal connections in addition to more local ones. The social media literature has reported how educators are using social media to connect with both peers and those more knowledgeable than themselves, similar to the interpersonal relationships with colleagues and mentors structured by formal induction programs. In addition, there are multiple points of connection between the informal learning opportunities educators (generally, not specifically ECEs) seek on social media and the supports offered to ECEs through formal induction programs. Both acknowledge the difficulty of the teaching profession and seek to support continuous learning that is often just-in-time, on-demand, and makes connections to experts. In this regard, social media have advantages by providing professional development that is truly just-in-time (Greenhalgh &amp; Koehler, 2017). Although research on teacher induction tends to foreground the local and research on social media tends to focus on the global, both bodies of research do cover both local and global relationships. Because of this, the recontextualization of ideas and resources is a challenge in both bodies of research. The informal learning opportunities afforded by social media are less systematic and structured than Kang and Berliner (2012), Zhukova (2018), and others have argued induction supports should be, while formal induction programs may present solutions too general to be useful to a particular ECE. Finally, a gap in the literature remains: research on teacher induction has not fully acknowledged the full array of interpersonal connections available to ECEs through social media today, and research on social media rarely focuses upon ECEs. This study seeks to addressed this gap in the literature, and I describe the purpose of this study in the following section. "],
["purpose-and-research-questions.html", "6 Purpose and Research Questions", " 6 Purpose and Research Questions The purpose of this study is to explore what supports for professional learning ECEs seek during induction, if any; from whom; and how, if at all, they use social media with the intention of seeking supports and connections. In other words, this study seeks to understand if and how ECEs navigate the edu-verse, looking for support in response to challenges experienced during induction. A PLN framing of this purpose suggests considering what ECEs are looking for and why, as well as who ECEs connect to — both locally and through social media. Thus, I will accomplish the research purpose by answering four research questions: RQ1. What supports for professional learning, if any, are ECEs seeking during induction? RQ2. What reasons, if any, do ECEs report for seeking induction supports, and what reasons do they give, if any, for not seeking induction supports? RQ3. What interpersonal connections do ECEs make when seeking supports for professional learning during induction? RQ4. How, if at all, do ECEs use social media as a modality to access supports for professional learning during induction? I will answer these research questions by asking ECEs about their induction experiences. First, I will interview ECEs to inductively establish themes related to my four research questions. From qualitative thematic analysis of the interviews, I will develop and administer a quantitative survey to see how widespread these induction experiences are among ECEs. Through this process, I will contribute to filling the gap in the literature by purposefully exploring both social media use and the specific experiences of ECEs. "],
["method.html", "7 Method 7.1 Stage 1 Methods: Qualitative Interviews 7.2 Stage 2 Methods: Quantitative Surveys 7.3 Stage 3 Methods: Interpretation", " 7 Method Because the intersection of teacher induction and educators’ social media use is under-researched, I will start by interviewing ECEs to ask them about their experiences as new educators: what supports for professional learning ECEs seek during induction, if any; from whom; and how, if at all, they use social media with the intention of seeking supports and connections. From the themes inferred from these interviews, I will develop and then administer a quantitative survey to see how broadly other ECEs identify with these themes. This methodological approach follows an exploratory sequential mixed methods design (Creswell, 2014, p. 225), an open-ended (i.e., exploratory) approach where data collection occurs in two stages (i.e., sequential): qualitative data are collected first and then used to determine which quantitative data should be collected. In mixed methods notation, this design is written as QUAL → quan, and the procedure will consist of three stages: (1) interview, (2) surveys, and (3) interpretation. This research design will allow me to develop “better measurement instruments by first collecting and analyzing qualitative data and then administering the instruments to a sample” (Creswell, 2014, p. 218). In this exploratory sequential design, the quantitative stage is directly dependent upon the earlier qualitative stage because the analysis of the interview data will be used to develop the survey instrument. Also, the two databases (i.e., qualitative and quantitative) are not compared in an exploratory sequential design because they are drawn from different samples; instead, the purpose of this design is “to determine if the qualitative themes can be generalized to a larger sample” (Creswell, 2014, p. 227). Specifically, three stages comprise this study: (1) the qualitative stage focused upon interviews, (2) the quantitative stage focused upon surveys, and (3) final interpretation. Creswell (2011) noted the presence of numerous controversies raised by mixed methods research — including a foundational question of whether it is appropriate, or even possible, to mix paradigms. Additionally, even if researchers have acquiesced to the possibility of blending elements from different paradigms, practical concerns remain. Mixed methods require a large amount of data and depend upon expertise with multiple research techniques. For instance, in an exploratory sequential design, care must be taken when trying to quantify or generalize qualitative data. However, in my proposed study, I believe the strengths of the exploratory sequential mixed methods design outweigh the concerns. For the purposes of this study, “the combination of methods provides a better understanding than either quantitative method or qualitative method alone” (Creswell, 2011, p. 280). The exploratory sequential design will allow me to: (a) use qualitative interview data to understand ECEs’ induction experiences and who they turn to for support, as well as related social media use, if any; (b) develop a quantitative survey instrument based on emergent themes from the interviews; and (c) use the survey to generalize the qualitative findings. Because of the absence of prior research at the intersection of teacher induction and ECEs’ social media use, this type of sequential, inductive, mixed methods approach will improve instrument fidelity (Collins, Onwuegbuzie, &amp; Sutton, 2006) by basing the survey scales on codes and themes drawn from interviews with early-career educators. 7.1 Stage 1 Methods: Qualitative Interviews In this first stage, I will conduct interviews with early-career educators to gather qualitative data about ECEs’ induction challenges and social media use. I will collect data to the point of theoretical saturation (Glaser &amp; Strauss, 1967) — what Glesne (2016) defined as the point when “successive examination of sources yields redundancy and that the data you have seem complete and integrated” (p. 194). In other words, I will continue to interview new participants until I am no longer finding new themes emerging from additional interviews. 1.1 Participants. The population of this study will be early-career educators (ECEs) working in the United States. Participants need not have majored in education as an undergraduate or pursued a graduate degree in education. They will likely be employed in a variety of subject areas. Following Ronfeldt and McQueen’s (2017) framing of ECEs, participants must have been employed in education for no more than three years. From the population of U.S.-based early-career educators, I will select a purposeful sample (Lincoln &amp; Guba, 1985) — a group of participants that will provide information-rich cases for in-depth study. I will seek to interview participants with a variety of backgrounds and experiences, purposefully seeking diversity in categories such as: (a) years of teaching experience, (b) grade level taught, (c) content area taught, (d) type of school (urban, suburban, rural), (e) zip code, (f) type of educator preparation (i.e., undergraduate, graduate, alternative certification, none), (g) ethnicity (Asian, Black/African, Causasian, Hispanic/Latinx, Middle Eastern, Native American, Pacific Islander, prefer to self-describe, prefer not to answer), and (h) gender (female, male, non-binary/third gender, prefer to self-describe, prefer not to answer). Finally, because of this study’s specific research purpose, I will collect information related to social media use: (i) social media platforms used, (j) length of time active on social media, (k) frequency of social media use (daily, several time a week, several times a month, rarely), and (l) professional purposes for social media use (following news and trends in education, seeking and giving emotional support related to job, finding and sharing educational resources and curricular materials, collaborating with colleagues in education, other). Specifically, I will sample participants from current Master of Arts in Educational Technology (MAET) students at Michigan State University because of my connections to the MAET program. That is, I am an alumnus of the degree program and currently teach one MAET course each semester as part of my doctoral assistantship. This group is a convenience sample, but it is also a purposeful sample. Although there is uniformity among MAET students in terms of a shared initiative to pursue a graduate degree during their first three years as educators and a presumably shared interest in educational technologies, there remain differences within this group. Students enter the MAET graduate program from a variety of educator preparation programs — including some with no formal background in education — and are educators in a variety of roles, subject areas, and geographic locations around the U.S. A benefit of this sample is that I can be confident that all participants have been introduced to social media use for professional learning in education. This shared background results from nearly every MAET course requiring some form of social media activity as an assignment, and the MAET program itself relies on social media to communicate and interact with its students. Nevertheless, having taught many MAET students myself, I believe I will be able to select a purposeful sample that demonstrates varying attitudes toward and uses of social media. In sum, although purposefully sampling MAET students will result in a sample that is not truly diverse, these participants are advantageous because of their common background with social media for professional use and differences in attitudes toward social media. Thus, although this sample will not be generalizable, it will adequately serve the purpose of generating themes that can be built into a quantitative survey. At the outset, I will seek permission from the MAET program coordinators to invite MAET students to participate in the interviews stage of my study. I will send a publicity email (Appendix A) to whatever list of MAET students I am granted access to and ask them to complete a Willingness to Participate form (Appendix B) through the online software Qualtrics (n.d.). At the start of each interview, I will ask for verbal consent by reading the script in the Interview Consent Form (Appendix C). Michigan State University’s Human Research Protection Program does not require a signature as an element of consent for “exempt” protocols (see https://hrpp.msu.edu/templates/consent.html), so I will only ask participants to verbally assent to this statement. 1.2 Pilot study. I anticipate asking interview questions (Appendix D: Initial Interview Protocol) grouped by topic into six sections. Following a first section where I ask background and warm-up questions, the second section will focus on challenges and struggles experienced as a new educator (RQ2). In this section, I will be prepared to ask follow up questions related to themes from the induction literature: everything is new, still learning to teach, developing professional identity (and related issues of agency and community). In the third section, I will ask about the types of supports sought during as a new educator (RQ1), including reasons why the interviewee may not have pursued supports (RQ2). I will also ask about the kinds of supports sought, drawing upon the literature for responses related to people orientation versus content orientation (Prestridge, 2019) and formal versus informal learning opportunities. In the fourth section, I will ask about interpersonal connections sought for supports as a new educator (RQ3), and I anticipate asking follow up questions about the types of individuals and groups that span local to global contexts. In the fifth section, I will ask questions about social media as a tool to access supports as a new educator (RQ4). Finally, in the sixth and final section, I will ask for any closing thoughts, specifically if there are any additional ways they would link their experiences as a new educator and their use of social media. Each section builds upon the preceding section(s), and in each section I will ask “Why?” as a follow up question to seek deeper understanding of participants’ initial answers. Section 5 of the interview protocol is adapted from Carpenter and Krutka’s (2014) survey instrument, which asked educators about their use of Twitter for professional purposes. I will ask similar questions for each social media platform that interviewees report using for seeking supports and interpersonal connections during induction. I will start by asking several participants to pilot my Willingness to Participate form (Appendix B) and Initial Interview Protocol (Appendix D). These pilot participants will share characteristics similar to the actual sample, but they will not be MAET students. I will recruit the pilot interviewees from my former undergraduate students in CEP 416 who have since started teaching positions. I will facilitate a mock interview with these participants on the video-communication software Zoom (n.d.). I will ask participants in these pilot interviews to respond not just to my questions, but to critically evaluate the questions themselves and give feedback on how questions could be improved. I will continue these pilot interviews to the point of saturation — that is, when I am no longer receiving new suggestions for how to improve the interview protocol. 1.3 Qualitative data collection. With an updated and revised interview protocol, I will host interviews on Zoom. I will also use Zoom’s built-in functionality to record audio and video of the interviews, and I will also take my own notes during the interviews. Because I am planning semi-structured interviews, the questions listed in the interview protocol (Appendix D) will serve as starting points, but the exact phrasing of questions will vary, and I will likely ask follow up questions based both on participants’ initial answers and expected themes drawn from the literature. For instance, if an interviewee says they do not use social media to access induction supports, I will ask them why not. I will conduct interviews until the point of theoretical saturation — in other words, when I am no longer finding new codes or themes in participants’ responses. 1.4 Qualitative data analysis. At the same time I am conducting interviews with new participants, I will also start transcribing completed interviews. I will do these transcriptions “by hand” — that is, by listening to the interview recordings and type out each word spoken during the interviews. However, I will not necessarily transcribe the full interview verbatim — some portions I will paraphrase, and others I will transcribe carefully. During my first listen to the recording, I will note major points in the conversation, and I will go back to listen a second time to those noteworthy portions. I will carefully and precisely transcribe these sections. I will upload interview transcripts to the software ATLAS.ti (2019). After I have transcribed the interviews, I will send a copy of the transcript to the interview participants to ask them if there are additional points they would like to make in addition to what was captured by the written transcript. I will also specifically ask for clarification in any instances where their responses were inaudible. After I have transcribed an interview, and in the midst of continuing to interview new participants and transcribe those interviews, I will conduct thematic analysis of the interview transcripts using the software ATLAS.ti (2019), which will help me track and compare codes and themes within and across interviews. I will follow Saldaña’s (2016) recommended procedures for open-ended qualitative analysis. Following his maxim, “Qualitative analysis calculates meaning” (Saldaña, 2016, p. 10), I will analyze the transcribed interview data for “consolidated meaning.” For the sake of simplicity as I propose this research, I will refer to these various possibilities for meaning as “themes,” while acknowledging that this meaning could take the form of categories, themes, concepts, or assertions. I anticipate two distinct cycles for the thematic analysis process. Saldaña (2016) used the language of “cycles” to emphasize that these steps are iterative; both first cycle and second cycle contain processes of coding and recoding the data. The first cycle will involve the assignment of codes, that is, “a word or short phrase that symbolically assigns a summative, salient, essence-capturing, and/or evocative attribute for a portion of language-based or visual data” (Saldaña, 2016, p. 4) to sections of the interview transcripts. These interview portions will be determined inductively, determined by what words, phrases, or even paragraphs seem to correspond to a code; the code is meant to capture the essential essence of the section (Saldaña, 2016). The second cycle coding will entail the reorganization and synthesis of the first cycle codes into new wholes, called categories; themes are then inferred from the categories (Saldaña, 2016). This means that during the second cycle, the number of codes should decrease in number and become more focused en route to developing broader categories and themes. After completing the second cycle of coding, I will test inter-rater reliability (IRR); I discuss IRR in more detail in the Trustworthiness of Research section. After completing the second cycle of coding and checking IRR, if there are still areas where I am unsure about my codes or categories, I will send that portion of the coded interview transcript to the interviewee and ask if they would like to provide further clarification. I will incorporate any additional input when developing the survey instrument. Saldaña (2016) illustrated the fluid nature of this entire coding process through what he termed eclectic coding. This approach illustrates “how an analyst can start with an array of coding methods for a ‘first draft’ of coding, then transition to strategic ‘second draft’ recoding decisions based on the learnings of the experience” (p. 212). To capture insights during the unpredictable and non-linear process of thematic analysis, I will write analytic memos at each step, noting key observations, connections, and inferred meaning made during the coding process. 1.5 Trustworthiness of research. I will take several steps to help readers find the qualitative stage of this proposed research to be trustworthy. Maxwell (2013) described validity in qualitative research as “the correctness or credibility of a description, conclusion, explanation, interpretation, or other sort of account” ( p. 122). Creswell and Miller (2000) noted that they find themselves most closely aligned “with the use of systematic procedures, employing rigorous standards and clearly identified procedures” (p. 129) — validity practices they associated with the “postpositivist or systematic paradigm” (p. 126). As I have considered various approaches to validity in qualitative work, I too find the systematic procedures to be most persuasive. Creswell and Miller (2000) also argued that in contrast to the ways quantitative researchers make inferences, “qualitative researchers use a lens not based on scores, instruments, or research designs but a lens established using the views of people who conduct, participate in, or read and review a study” (p. 125). In qualitative research, I myself — as researcher — am the instrument used in inquiry (Patton, 2002). As is the case with any research, it is essential to reduce the error — or bias — of the instrument. Creswell and Miller (2000) suggested reducing bias by approaching qualitative analysis with three different lenses: the researcher, participants, and external readers; here I describe systematic procedures linked to each lens. First, Creswell and Miller (2000) suggested looking at analysis through a researcher lens by triangulation: “a systematic process of sorting through the data to find common themes or categories by eliminating overlapping areas” (Creswell &amp; Miller, 2000, p. 127). I will triangulate across participants in the inductive coding and categorization of thematic analysis of interview data. Second, Creswell and Miller (2000) suggested looking at analysis through a participant lens by member checking: the process of confirming with participants that the themes and categories I inferred make sense and are sufficiently supported with evidence. For each interview, I will give participants two opportunities to provide member checks. First, after I have completed the written transcription of an interview, I will give the interviewee the opportunity to read through the transcript and add points they did not get to say during the interview. Second, after I have completed the second cycle of thematic analysis, I will send the coded transcript to the interviewee and point to one or two specific places where I was unsure about my code, categories, and themes. I will ask the interviewee if they would like to provide further clarification. Third, Creswell and Miller (2000) suggested looking at analysis through an external reader lens by creating an audit trail: the process of “documenting the inquiry process through journaling and memoing, keeping a research log of all activities, developing a data collection chronology, and recording data analysis procedures clearly” (Creswell &amp; Miller, 2000, p. 128). Throughout the study, I will create thorough documentation through analytic memos, and I will record and update notes and definitions of codes, categories, and themes in a codebook. I will ask at least one member of my dissertation committee to carefully read through this audit trail to ensure my findings are grounded in the data and my inferences are logical. Finally, after the second cycle of coding, I will test inter-rater reliability (IRR). I will recruit a second coder from my doctoral program to apply definitions from the codebook to a portion of the interview transcripts — sections randomly selected from several interviews, representing approximately 10% of the interview corpus. I will then calculate IRR scores — both percent agreement and Cohen’s kappa — to ensure that the emergent coding categories and definitions in my codebook are clear and reproducible. The Cohen’s kappa scores for each coding category should be .61 or higher to achieve what Landis and Koch (1977) described as “substantial” agreement (p. 165). If the kappas are .60 or less, I will discuss coding discrepancies with the second coder, revise the codebook, and select a new random sample of 10% of the interview corpus. I will repeat these steps until the kappas show substantial agreement. Ensuring inter-rater reliability is particularly important in this research design because I am using the codes and themes from the qualitative analysis to construct a survey instrument, and I will subsequently ask many early-career educators to complete that survey. If my categories and themes are unclear to one doctoral student colleague, I would have reason to worry about the clarity of my resulting survey questions for non-academic educators I do not know. 7.2 Stage 2 Methods: Quantitative Surveys In this second stage, I will develop and administer a survey to gather quantitative data. Because the purpose of this stage is to generalize the qualitative findings, I will aim to distribute the survey instrument as broadly as possible — to as many U.S. early-career educators as possible. I will regularly monitor responses as tracked in Qualtrics (n.d.), and I will continue to publicize the survey on Twitter (as described in the Participants section earlier) and send email reminders until I have confirmed complete and valid responses from a sufficiently large sample (at minimum, n ≥ 100) of early-career educators. 2.1 Participants. As was the case with the Stage 1 qualitative interviews, here in Stage 2 the population remains early-career educators (ECEs) working in the United States, employed in education for no more than three years. Participants need not have majored in education as an undergraduate or pursued a graduate degree in education, and they will likely be employed in a variety of subject areas. 2.2 Pilot study. I will start Stage 2 by building a survey instrument with questions and scales. The survey will be developed in and administered with Qualtrics (n.d.). DeVellis (2017) defined a scale as a measurement instrument consisting of a group of items combined into a composite score which is meant to demonstrate a degree or level of an underlying variable. He named the underlying variable a latent variable: a phenomenon of interest that is not directly observable. Scales help measure latent variables that cannot be assessed directly. Not every set of items is necessarily a scale; rather, each item that is part of a scale should be considered a test, even on its own, of the strength of the latent variable. (DeVellis, 2017). Finally, it is also helpful to note the differences between scaling and categorizing. Categorizing is a process of describing the presence or absence of a phenomenon, assuming an all-or-nothing state; in contrast, scaling is a process of describing the degree of a condition, assuming a continuum (DeVellis, 2017). A common item format is the Likert scale, which presents degrees along a continuum between opposite poles (e.g., Agree-Disagree, Very likely-Very unlikely) or frequency. Likert scales are good for measuring latent variables such as opinions, beliefs, and attitudes (DeVellis, 2017). The survey instrument will begin with the Survey Consent Form (Appendix E). Although the exact content of the survey instrument will not be developed until after the qualitative stage is completed, I do expect the survey instrument to be organized into five sections of questions and scales related to each of my four research questions, parallel to the sections of the interview protocol: Types of supports for professional learning sought during induction (RQ1), Reasons for seeking supports for professional learning during induction and reasons for not seeking supports (RQ2), Interpersonal connections made for supports for professional learning during induction (RQ3), Social media as a modality to access supports for professional learning during induction (RQ4), and Background information matching the categories in the Willingness to Participate form (see Procedure Step 1.1 and Appendix B): (a) years of teaching experience, (b) grade level taught, (c) content area taught, (d) type of school (urban, suburban, rural), (e) zip code, (f) type of educator preparation (i.e., undergraduate, graduate, alternative certification, none), (g) ethnicity (Asian, Black/African, Causasian, Hispanic/Latinx, Middle Eastern, Native American, Pacific Islander, prefer to self-describe, prefer not to answer), and (h) gender (female, male, non-binary/third gender, prefer to self-describe, prefer not to answer). Finally, because of this study’s specific research purpose, I will collect information related to social media use: (i) social media platforms used, (j) length of time active on social media, (k) frequency of social media use (daily, several time a week, several times a month, rarely), and (l) professional purposes for social media use (following news and trends in education, seeking and giving emotional support related to job, finding and sharing educational resources and curricular materials, collaborating with colleagues in education, other). With results from qualitative thematic analysis of the interview data in Stage 1, I will follow Creswell’s (2014) recommended process for moving from qualitative analysis to quantitative scale development in constructing sections 1-4 of the survey instrument: “using the quotes to write items for an instrument, the codes to develop variables that group the items, and themes that group the codes into scales” (p. 226). I offer an overview of this process in Table 2. Table 2 Moving from Qualitative to Quantitative in Survey Creation Qualitative Examples Quantitative Examples Quotes ‘I couldn’t have made it through my first year teaching without my mentor.’ Items ‘frequency of talking to mentor’, ‘topics discussed with mentor’ Codes ‘mentor’, ‘coach’, ‘guide’, ‘expertise’ Latent Variables ‘value of having a mentor during induction’ Themes ‘mentoring is essential during induction’ Scales Mentor Induction Support Scale As an example, if “mentoring is essential during induction” was a theme inferred from qualitative analysis, then a latent variable associated with this theme might be “the value of having a mentor during induction.” I would measure this variable through the development of a Mentor Induction Support Scale, likely modeled off of Strano and Queen’s (2012) survey development in their mixed methods study. To study identity management on Facebook, Strano and Queen (2012) interviewed 30 U.S. Facebook users to develop a scale for the Likelihood of posting, untagging, or requesting deletion of certain images. This scale asked: “How likely would you be to (post, untag, request deletion) an image which…” and then offered 13 scenarios. In my study, the Mentor Induction Support Scale might ask a similarly constructed question: “How important would it be for you to have a mentor during induction so you could…” and then offered a variety of scenarios based off of the qualitative interviews. This would be answered with a series of items, formatted as Likert scales presenting a continuum from “very important” to “not at all important.” I would describe this scale in my study report: I will assess the latent variable “value of having a mentor during induction” using eight items on a 5-point Likert scale (range: 8-40) and calculate Cronbach’s alpha for this scale. Cronbach’s alpha is a common measure of a scale’s internal validity, which I describe in more detail below. As a second example, to address RQ4, I will use a Social Media Usage Frequency Scale modeled off Valdez, Schaar, and Ziefle’s (2012) five-point-Likert scale (1 = daily, 2 = several times a week, 3 =several times a month, 4 = rarer, 5 = never). In general, I will use 5-point Likert scales. During the scale development stage in Owen, Fox, &amp; Bird’s (2016) exploratory sequential mixed methods study, they argued that five points on the scale achieves a balance between not overwhelming respondents with too many options and still having enough categories to be able to distinguish between them and find nuance between the different points. I am aware of the threat that bots pose to spam online surveys (e.g., the issues discussed in this tweet thread. I will take precautions to filter out bots from my responses, such as: requiring captcha verification from respondents, embedding “honeypot” items (i.e., question invisible to humans but visible to bots), and including a question asking “What is this survey about?” In addition, the Qualtrics (n.d.) survey software should help with additional bot detection. I will also consider the inclusion of validation items (DeVellis, 2017) used to detect competing influences on respondents’ answers. For instance, Devellis (2017) recommended the inclusion of a scale to measure social desirability (e.g., Strahan &amp; Gerbasi, 1972) to determine if participants’ responses were unduly motivated by a desire to be perceived positively by the researcher. I will refine the survey instrument by administering a pilot survey to several early-career educators — as with the interviews, students not in the MAET program but still ECEs. As with the interview pilot, I will start by asking former students from CEP 416 who have started teaching positions. I will ask these respondents to offer feedback on the initial survey instrument and suggestions for improvement. I will pilot the survey with new participants to the point of saturation — that is, when I am no longer receiving new suggestions. With this feedback, I will update the survey instrument. After refining the survey instrument with pilot feedback, I will calculate Cronbach’s alphas as measures of internal reliability for each scale included in the survey instrument. Remler and Van Ryzin (2011) defined this type of reliability as the “internal consistency of the various indicators. Do the indicators or items go together — do they paint a consistent picture?” (p. 122). DeVellis (2017) argued that, despite its limitations, Cronbach’s alpha is still useful because it provides a lower bound, or conservative estimate of internal reliability. I will follow DeVellis’ (2017) recommendations that a Cronbach’s alpha score between .65 and .70 is minimally acceptable, between .70 and .80 is respectable, and between .80 and .90 is very good. Because a scale’s alpha is influenced by both the number of items in the scale and the degree of covariation among the items, there is a tradeoff between keeping a scale short (which is desirable for respondents’ time) and lengthening the scale (which is desirable for increasing reliability). Thus, if a scale’s alpha is below .70, I will identify any items with lower-than-average correlation with the other items and test to see the effect of removing those items from the scale. If their average correlations are not sufficiently below the mean that their removal increases the alpha, I will instead add additional items to the scale as the way to increase the alpha. On the other hand, if a scale’s alpha is above .90, I will reduce the number of items in the scale (DeVellis, 2017), which also reduces the burden on the respondent. 2.3 Quantitative data collection. Following the distribution strategies of survey studies such as Carpenter and Krutka (2014) and Trust et al. (2016), I will publicize the survey on Twitter broadly over a period of time. First, I will send a series of publicity tweets (Appendix F) using different education-related hashtags (e.g., #NT2T, #ntchat, #isteten, #PSTPLN, #Edchat, #sschat, #iteachmath, #MTBoS, #NCTEchat, #engchat, #langchat, #michED, #educolor, #cleartheair, #eloned, #edcamp, #edumatch, #SocialMediaEd, #spedchat, #t2t, #teacheredchat, #teachertraining, #satchat, etc.) over the course of numerous weeks. Second, I will also ask teacher-educator colleagues (e.g., Koehler, Greenhow, Rosenberg, Greenhalgh, Akcaoglu, Carpenter, Morrison, Krutka, Trust, Heath, Dennen, Bagdy, Kessler, Lachney, Yadav, Foster, Peterson, etc.) to help tweet and retweet the invitation to complete the survey. Third, I will email a link to the survey to all respondents to the initial call to MAET students (see step 1.1) who were not chosen for interviews. Fourth, at the end of the survey instrument, I will ask respondents to also consider sharing the survey with their own networks (i.e., snowball promotion). As a final note, interview participants will not be eligible to complete the survey, because this would “introduce undue duplication of responses” (Creswell, 2014, p. 227). 2.4 Quantitative data analysis. With all survey data collected, I will conduct quantitative analyses using the statistical computing software R (R Core Team, 2018). Because the purpose of this quantitative stage is to generalize the qualitative findings, I will focus on calculating descriptive statistics summarizing survey results. More specifically, I will calculate mean, standard deviation, median, and range for each survey item. This will allow me to answer the research questions not as deeply or with as thick description as through qualitative interviews, but I will be able to describe which induction supports are most desired (answering RQ1), the most common reasons ECEs report for seeking supports for professional learning during induction and reasons for not seeking supports (answering RQ2), the most common types of interpersonal connections for induction support (answering RQ3), and how often they use social media with this intent and which platforms are preferred (answering RQ4). 2.5 Validity and reliability. I will attend to the trustworthiness of this quantitative stage of research by following procedures to increase validity and reliability. To start, I acknowledge that my survey distribution strategy is its own form of sampling bias, replete with external validity issues. Still, I will check the construct validity of these quantitative analyses by asking: “Does the measure behave in a statistical model in a way that would be expected, based on theory and prior research?” (Remler &amp; Van Vyzin, 2011, pp. 113). This reporting will be a priority in my discussion of the results of this study. I will also follow one of the validity procedures from the qualitative stage here as well: the audit trail conducted by an external reader. I will ask a colleague to review my R code and run the analysis script. This will ensure that I have documented my code sufficiently for someone else to understand and that the program runs on a machine other than my own computer. Finally, I will check internal reliability by calculating Cronbach’s alphas for each scale included in the survey instrument. During the pilot study I will check alphas and adjust the scales (by adding or removing) items as necessary. I will also check alphas after the final collection of surveys, noting any issues with internal reliability in my final report of the study. 7.3 Stage 3 Methods: Interpretation Finally, after completion of the qualitative interview stage and and quantitative survey stage, I will conduct a final interpretation of my findings. As I stated earlier, I will not compare the qualitative findings to the quantitative findings because they are inferred from different samples. Instead, I will note which of the qualitative findings seem to be generalizable to the larger survey sample, as inferred from the quantitative stage. "],
["anticipated-findings.html", "8 Anticipated Findings 8.1 RQ1: Induction Supports for Professional Learning 8.2 RQ2: Reasons for Seeking Induction Supports and Reasons for Not Seeking Supports 8.3 RQ3: Interpersonal Connections for Induction Supports 8.4 RQ4: Use of Social Media as a Modality to Access Induction Supports", " 8 Anticipated Findings The purpose of this study is to explore what supports for professional learning ECEs seek during induction, if any; from whom; and how, if at all, they use social media with the intention of seeking supports and connections. Although I do not know exactly what I will find as a result of this study, I have several hypotheses, which I describe in the following paragraphs. 8.1 RQ1: Induction Supports for Professional Learning I expect that some common themes will emerge from the qualitative interviews regarding the types of induction supports for professional learning ECEs are looking for. These themes may include help with time management, classroom management, relating to students, and content expertise (subject-matter questions), as well as a felt need for emotional encouragement. I do not have a prediction for how generalizable these themes will be to the larger sample in the quantitative survey stage. 8.2 RQ2: Reasons for Seeking Induction Supports and Reasons for Not Seeking Supports It may be the case that ECEs have difficulty reporting their needs, but they may still be able to identify things that are not working. If this is true, then I might expect ECEs to describe frustrations with district-mandated professional development sessions that are too general to be useful and end up feeling like a waste of time. I expect ECEs to report seeking induction supports in response to a specific felt need that prompts them to search for help or an answer. However, because of frustrating prior experiences with inductions supports, I anticipate some ECEs to report not seeking induction supports. In addition, some ECEs may choose not to access induction supports through the modality of social media because they feel that their circumstance would be too specific for outsiders to understand and offer meaningful support. For instance, an ECE in a high-poverty school may feel that a stranger outside this context would not be able to understand their situation enough to offer meaningful support. 8.3 RQ3: Interpersonal Connections for Induction Supports I expect that ECEs will report connecting with a variety of individuals and groups in search of induction supports. Individuals may include instructors and classmates from their preparation programs; peers, mentors, and administrators in their school of employment; and friends, colleagues, and edu-celebrities on social media. Groups may include cohorts from the preparation program or school of employment, structured online learning communities like the PLNs facilitated by the International Society for Technology in Education (ISTE, n.d.), as well as more informal gatherings and conversations such as education-related Twitter hashtags, Pinterest boards, or even the personal school-external networks described by März and Kelchtermans (2020). 8.4 RQ4: Use of Social Media as a Modality to Access Induction Supports I expect that there will be parallels between the kinds of experiences that ECEs have with social media-mediated induction supports and their offline, face-to-face ones. That is, I expect that ECEs will seek many of the same supports on social media as they do offline, for many of the same reasons, and from similar types of interpersonal connections. However, I do expect there to be differences, particularly in terms of the reasons why they seek induction supports or not. I expect that ECEs will report using social media to find induction supports because of the ease of use, time efficiency, and just-in-time support that is essential to ECEs who are still figuring out on a day-to-day basis what their needs are. I expect themes to emerge related to a cost-benefit analysis (whether conscious or unconscious) of whether social media are worth the time, distractions, overwhelming number of connections and resources, and sense of doing extra work outside school hours. The reasons why ECEs choose not to seek induction supports may be exacerbated by the social media modality. That is, if an ECE felt like someone outside their high-poverty school would not understand their context and be able to offer meaningful support, this feeling may be even stronger when considering whether an unknown person on social media elsewhere in the world would have something to offer. This study presents an opportunity to ask interview participants and survey respondents which social media platforms they use to seek connections for induction support. I expect some ECEs to describe using a variety of social media platforms to look for help, such as Instagram, Pinterest, TeachersPayTeachers, Twitter, Facebook groups, and Reddit. Of course, ECEs are also likely to turn to offline supports as well — even self-initiated ones — such as colleagues in their school building, and some may even ask their students for feedback. Still, I expect that ECEs will be seeking support not just from their preparation program or their current professional context, but from the edu-verse, the multitude of resources and connections available through social media. The findings from this study will help create an updated map of the extent of the edu-verse as well as how often ECEs use different platforms. I expect that the participation inequality that has been well-documented in online and social media communities (e.g., Nielson, 2006; Staudt Willet, 2019) will be evident in the survey results — a small number of respondents will use social media frequently to make connections related to their induction needs, whereas a large majority of respondents will use social media infrequently and some not at all for this purpose. In addition, even amongst those who use social media frequently, the manner of use will vary. I expect that most of the frequent users will be in the “lurker” — or, in a less negative connotation, “observer” (Edelmann, 2013) — category, which Prestridge (2019) termed “info-consumer.” This result would be welcome, as it would illustrate a benefit of my mixed method approach: by interviewing and surveying ECEs, I can collect rich data from those who choose to contribute little to no content to social media but are participants nonetheless. This is a distinct advantage over the data-mining, “digital traces” methods of my past research (e.g., Staudt Willet, 2019; Staudt Willet &amp; Carpenter, 2019), where data collection is limited to observable behaviors and content. In this study, I will be able to gather thought processes and emotions, regardless of whether content is shared. I expect that ECEs’ experiences and interpretations will vary; some will love everything about the interpersonal connections they have made on social media, and others will describe social media as confusing and overwhelming. If this hypothesis holds, these findings would be an interesting contrast to the bulk of research in educational technology that seems to present social media affordances as overwhelmingly positive. In this study, I do not expect ECEs to report such a positive perception of their own social media participation. "],
["significance.html", "9 Significance 9.1 Implications for Practice 9.2 Implications for Research", " 9 Significance 9.1 Implications for Practice Results from this study should offer practical implications for ECEs, teacher educators, and teacher mentors. ECEs may benefit from reading about how their peers have sought support during induction — or why they have chosen not to — and whether social media (and which platforms) seemed to aid accessing supports and making interpersonal connections. If a number of ECEs have found certain social media platforms to be beneficial and others to be problematic, then their peers could determine which practices to engage in or avoid. Teacher educators and mentors may benefit from knowing what current offerings of induction supports feel unhelpful to ECEs as well as what kinds of informal professional learning practices feel worthwhile. This would enable teacher educators and mentors to complement their formal efforts in supporting ECEs with additional options for induction support through social media, as well as an understanding of when to offer appropriate caution to ECEs seeking their own self-initiated solutions. This study has timely and practical significance because there continue to be high rates of attrition and turnover among ECEs, with high costs to students, schools, and districts. Induction challenges have real effects on ECEs, who feel like they are in survival mode (Thompson et al., 2013; Zhukova, 2018), left to “sink or swim” in the isolation of their own classrooms and educational contexts (Ingersoll, 2012). In recent years, teachers have been leaving the classroom at an unprecedented rate (Carver-Thomas &amp; Darling-Hammond, 2017; Hackman &amp; Morath, 2018; Hargreaves &amp; Fullan, 2012), with especially high attrition among ECEs (Ronfeldt &amp; McQueen, 2017). The cost of teacher attrition impacts numerous parties. School districts pay a price — for instance, more than $20,000 to replace each teacher who leaves an urban school district (Carver-Thomas &amp; Darling-Hammond, 2017). More importantly, educator turnover can negatively affect students, reducing learner achievement (Carver-Thomas &amp; Darling-Hammond, 2017; Ronfeldt, Loeb, &amp; Wyckoff, 2013). The departing educators themselves find themselves in the midst of a confluence of factors that lead to departure; Dunn’s (2018) study of publicly-shared resignation letters revealed that educators left the profession with intense emotion and regret, but nonetheless still committed to the needs of students. Clandinin et al. (2015) concluded that efforts should focus on questions of sustaining educators rather than questions of retaining them — which means attending to the lives of ECEs and not just identifying factors that cause attrition. Educator preparation programs, formal induction programs, and teacher professional development have not yet solved these problems, and research on educators’ uses of social media have not yet even considered these issues. The possibilities afforded by social media seem to be a promising solution, but it may also be the case that the increased connectivity afforded by social media creates new problems for ECEs even while alleviating others. Putnam and Borko (2000) argued that although new kinds of learning communities may offer opportunities for improving educational practice, these opportunities may also usher in new tensions. Horn, Nolen, Ward, and Campbell (2008) warned there are both potential benefits and problems resulting from the tension that arises from navigating between the traditionally conceived two worlds of the educator preparation program and the professional teaching context. On one hand, conflicting messages help novices develop their pedagogical reasoning and ability to adapt and contextualize; on the other hand, if there is too much difficulty, the theory of the preparation program is often abandoned in favor of the practices of new colleagues (Feiman-Nemser &amp; Buchmann, 1985; Horn et al., 2008). In addition, if the two worlds notion is expanded to an edu-verse to take into consideration how ECEs might seek support through social media, new tensions may be introduced in addition to the benefits. For instance, it is likely that ECEs will have difficulty determining the quality of resources found through social media and contextualizing resources that were sourced globally (Jones &amp; Preece, 2006). Additionally, some ECEs may choose not to avail themselves any induction supports, with particularly strong feelings toward supports accessed through social media. In sum, this study will contribute new understanding to the convergence of tensions that may be felt by ECEs as they consider whether or not to seek induction supports, including whether or not to look for help on social media. This contribution will have implications for following Clandinin et al.’s (2015) recommendation to seek to sustain ECEs by attending to their lived experiences, not just aim to retain them. 9.2 Implications for Research Ingersoll and Strong (2011) argued that future research on teacher induction needs to be rooted in theory and be critical; future studies must go beyond whether or not an induction support works and should also answer why. The exploratory sequential mixed methods design of this study will help deepen understanding of induction supports. This design is appropriate for creating an initial understanding of a phenomenon of interest, as would be the case for filling the gap between research on teacher induction and research on educators’ use of social media. This study’s design will allow ECEs to report what supports for professional learning they are seeking during induction, if any; underlying reasons why; what individuals and groups they are connecting to; and how, if at all, they use social media toward this end. This study’s purpose and research questions represent a structured application of the PLN framework, using this concept as a lens to prompt questions of what, why, who, and how (if at all) with social media. Other researchers should find the PLN framework and these subsequent research questions to be useful for exploring additional questions about how educators of all experience levels seek professional learning. The findings from this study — both the qualitative and quantitative results — should also suggest a number of various directions for future research. For example, the results will provide research questions for a study implementing data-mining methods — the emergent themes will suggest which digital traces to look for and how to analyze them. An additional contribution of this work to educational research is the survey instrument itself, inductively developed from qualitative data collected from actual ECEs. The survey instrument could be used by future researchers for more targeted studies of new educators — defining cases, for instance, by geography, gender, or ethnicity. In addition, although inferential statistics are beyond the scope of the proposed study, an immediate follow up study could develop multi-level models to determine variance within and between the demographic categories recorded by the survey. In other words, this inferential approach would measure potential effects of: (a) years of teaching experience, (b) grade level taught, (c) content area taught, (d) type of school (urban, suburban, rural), (e) zip code, (f) type of educator preparation (i.e., undergraduate, graduate, alternative certification, none), (g) ethnicity (Asian, Black/African, Causasian, Hispanic/Latinx, Middle Eastern, Native American, Pacific Islander, prefer to self-describe , prefer not to answer), and (h) gender (female, male, non-binary/third gender, prefer to self-describe, prefer not to answer). Finally, because of this study’s specific research purpose, I will collect information related to social media use: (i) social media platforms used, (j) length of time active on social media, (k) frequency of social media use (daily, several time a week, several times a month, rarely), and (l) professional purposes for social media use (following news and trends in education, seeking and giving emotional support related to job, finding and sharing educational resources and curricular materials, collaborating with colleagues in education, other).

["potential-ethical-issues.html", "10 Potential Ethical Issues", " 10 Potential Ethical Issues I do not anticipate any significant ethical issues in this study. Because I will be interacting with early-career educators through interviews and surveys, I anticipate my Institutional Review Board (IRB) to categorize this work as human-subject research; read about the exempt categories here. However, I hope that IRB will deem this study as Exempt 2(ii): Research involving the use of educational tests, survey procedures, interview procedures or observation of public behavior and disclosure of subjects’ responses outside research would not reasonably place the subjects at risk. I plan to send my interview protocol and survey instrument to IRB as part of my review, and I will send updates after the protocol and survey have been edited after piloting. I will also create pseudonyms for all self-reported data from interviews and surveys, storing the identity key in a separate, encrypted file. "],
["conclusion.html", "11 Conclusion", " 11 Conclusion The proposed study tackles a significant, emergent problem at the intersection of the fields of teacher education and educational technology. Social media create new opportunities and new tensions that are not yet fully understood by educational researchers. The stakes are high, as teacher attrition has a high cost to students, schools, and districts. This study fills a gap in the literature by considering both the scope of potential interpersonal connections made through social media and the particular needs of early-career educators. Using a multi-stage mixed methods design of qualitative interviews leading to a quantitative survey, I will explore what supports for professional learning early-career educators seek during induction, if any; from whom; and how, if at all, they use social media with the intention of seeking supports and connections.
