# dissertation-proposal-text

This repo contains the full text of my final dissertation proposal document, rendered using the **bookdown** package (https://github.com/rstudio/bookdown) in R, which in turn was built on top of R Markdown and **knitr** (https://github.com/yihui/knitr).

Please see the page "[Get Started](https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/get-started.html)" at https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/ for how to compile this proposal into HTML. You may generate a copy of the book in `bookdown::pdf_book` format by calling `bookdown::render_book('index.Rmd', 'bookdown::pdf_book')`. More detailed instructions are available here https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/build-the-book.html.

You can find the preview of this example at https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown-demo/.
