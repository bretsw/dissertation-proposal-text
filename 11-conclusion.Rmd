# Conclusion

The proposed study tackles a significant, emergent problem at the intersection of the fields of teacher education and educational technology. Social media create new opportunities and new tensions that are not yet fully understood by educational researchers. The stakes are high, as teacher attrition has a high cost to students, schools, and districts. This study fills a gap in the literature by considering both the scope of potential interpersonal connections made through social media and the particular needs of early-career educators. Using a multi-stage mixed methods design of qualitative interviews leading to a quantitative survey, I will explore what supports for professional learning early-career educators seek during induction, if any; from whom; and how, if at all, they use social media with the intention of seeking supports and connections.
